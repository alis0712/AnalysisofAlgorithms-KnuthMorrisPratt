# Analysis of Algorithms - Pattern Searching 
In this project we focused on two string matching algorithms which are 
1) Naïve algorithm for pattern searching (Brute-Force) 
2) Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. 

In this project we were asked to test using 3 characters a, b, and c, and then randomly generate them
with a string size of 1000. We were then asked to search for the string abcba. Finally, we were asked to
execute the time it took to compute the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string search, and compare it
with the Naïve Pattern Search (brute-force) result of m by n. We implemented both algorithms in
Python. The results were as follows:
